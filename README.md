# Game Jam 2025

This project is a simple template for a 2D game made for a game jam.

The included sample map is **15Ã—20 tiles** and currently fits on one screen.
Future updates may allow for larger maps with scrolling. Map loading logic is
handled in `Level._load_map`, while drawing is done in the rendering code.
